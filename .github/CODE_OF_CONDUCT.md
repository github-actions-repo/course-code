**Privacy, security, and freedom of expression**

Always keep in mind that we're asking people to put their trust in us with their sensitive data. To keep that trust, each of us must respect and safeguard the privacy and security of that information. Our security protocols place strict restrictions on who has access to and uses users' personal data and require us to secure user information from unauthorized access. Understand your obligations under these procedures; gather, use and access user personal information only as permitted by our security policies, privacy policies, and data protection laws.


**Workplace health, safety, and security**

Partners may observe all safety rules and practices, cooperate with officials enforcing these rules and procedures, and take all required precautions to safeguard themselves and other partners. They must also complete safety training and report any accidents, injuries, or dangerous activities or conditions. To strengthen workplace security, you may be familiar with and follow any work safety information and training provided to you.


**Drugs and alcohol**

We have a clear attitude on substance abuse: it is harmful to our employees' health and safety and we do not accept it. Our workplaces do not restrict the consumption of alcohol. Still, you may use caution and never drink in a way that affects performance, causes improper behavior, endangers the safety of others, or breaks the law. Using illegal substances in our workplace or at sponsored events is strictly forbidden. Assume a manager has reason to believe that an employee's usage of drugs and alcohol is hurting their job performance and the safety of others at work. In that instance, the manager can ask for an alcohol or drug test.

**Conflicts of interest**

We must all avoid potential conflicts of interest. When a personal interest or activity interferes with or appears to interfere with the tasks you perform or owe to our company, you have a conflict of interest. Even the most ethical individual can be influenced unknowingly by a conflict of interest. The mere appearance of a conflict can cause a partner's actions or integrity to be questioned.

Potential conflicts of interest must be brought to attention through the partner's manager or the vice president in charge of the partner's department or business unit, who will contact the chief ethics and compliance officer, besides the yearly report. Disclosure can be made directly via Business Ethics and Compliance if the partner prefers.

**Compliance with laws and regulations**

We are committed to abiding by all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in the countries where we operate. When performing your duties, you must follow all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. If you believe there is any discrepancy, or if you have a question about the legality of your or your partners' actions, you can consult with a manager or other party via our complaints and concern channel.
